# Introduction

This project is a part of the course database tech and web based systems. The
task is to develop a web based application. In this case this will be done in a
group of 3. The program has to in some way do the following:

* Implement CRUD-functionality
* Implement a login
* Store information 
* The web page has to present data from the database
* Implement an input field 
* The auto generated code needs to be in coherence with W3C recommendations


# Project description

At the Interaction and design programme there's a lot of freedom to pick and chose
what type of courses you want to study. Some of them are good and some of them
might seem interesting but turn out not to be so good. That's why there's a need
for a program where you can rate the courses relevant to the programme. 

The goal of this project is to create a web application where users can view,
create, edit, review course information. The idea is that the webpage should be
self maintaining to avoid having the need for a moderator. With that said there
needs to be an admin that should be able to remove posts.

When reviewing a webpage, user's should be able to write their thoughts about
the course in a short format. They should also be able to recommend or not
recommend the course in form of thumbs up or thumbs down. These reviews should
be visible to other users.

When creating course information, the user should be able to write a short
description about the course as link to the main site for course description.

# Division of labor

Everyone in the team are flexible in what they're working in. With that said
everyone has a key responsibility of making sure certain things happen. Marc is
the project leader and responsible for scheduling, turning in documents and
making sure the dynamic in the team is good. Viyan is responsible for the design
and has the final say in all design decisions. Isak is responsible for the back
end.
