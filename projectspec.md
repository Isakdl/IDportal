# Introduction

This project is a part of the course database tech and web based systems. The
task is to develop a web based application. In this case this will be done in a
group of 3. The program has to in some way do the following:

* Implement CRUD-functionality
* Change the routing
* Implement a login
* Store information in the form of cookies and sessions
* The web page has to present data from the database
* Implement an input field following WCAG and WAI's recommendations
* The auto generated code needs to be in coherence with W3C recommendations


# Project description

At the Interaction and design program there's a lot of freedom to pick and chose
what type of courses you want to study. Some of them are good and some of them
might seem interesting but turn out not to be so good. That's why there's a need
for a program where you can rate the courses at Ume√• University. 

The goal of this project is to create a web application where an admin can
create courses, edit and add courses with descriptions so that users then can
login, rate and comment the courses. It will also function as a place where
users can find and upload helpful resources such as old exams and notes from
students.

# System description

The web application will be implemented using a software called Meteor which is
a compilation of applications such as MongoDB and React. 


# Priorities

The priorities below are listed from most important to least important and only
encompasses the solution and not the project itself.

2. Ability to rate courses
3. Login for admins
4. Login for users

6. Ability for users to recommend and not recommend courses
7. Ability for users to add a review, this is analyzed in coherence to W3C
   recommendations.

# Division of labor

We all split the work between each other but everyone has a different
responsibility to make sure something happens. Viyan has the main responsibility
of design, Marc is the project leader and Isak has the main responsibility back
end.
